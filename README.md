PC Bots
=======

This repository is a compilation of my small-scale PC bots. Each bot is abstracted from a Main class that controls generics. It should be noted that the robots are designed for optimal use on my own personal laptop. Results will vary on other machines. Specific locations may need to be changed on machines with different resolutions. The content may also not be up to date. User Interfaces change frequently and can be difficult to keep up with. I will update to accomodate these changes whenever I notice an issue exists.
